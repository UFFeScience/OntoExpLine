## OntoExpLine: An Ontology for Experiment Lines

## Overview

This repository presents a guide for OntoExpLine, an ontology for experiment lines, which give support to scientists to derive workflows that are composed of variant programs that implement the same activity on the flow.
Moreover, this structure permit store, relate and apply reasoners mechanisms to query provenance and domain data that were used to compose the scientific experiment and the data product generated during the experiment execution. OntoExpLine is composed of four specific modules: workflow structure, experiment line, domain-data branch, and metadata block.
