# OntoExpLine
An Ontology for Experiment Lines.

## Overview

This repository presents a guide for OntoExpLine, an ontology for experiment lines, which give support to scientists to derive workflows that are composed of variant programs that implement the same activity on the flow.
Moreover, this structure permit store, relate and apply reasoners mechanisms to query provenance and domain data that were used to compose the scientific experiment and the data product generated during the experiment execution. OntoExpLine is composed of four specific modules: workflow structure, experiment line, domain-data branch, and metadata block.


## Introduction

## Aspect covered by OntoExpLine
(tipos de dados relacionados - workflow, linha de experimento, metadados, domínio, tabela de classes e propriedades)
OntoExpLine aims to provide the fundamental information required to understand and analyze scientific workflow-based on the derivable profile in their abstract activities. The structure uses domain data to create variations and metadata to explain their use in the context of experiment lines. This way, OntoExpLine is based on four ontologies: ProveONE [] to define the structure of the workflow, EDAM [] to take the domain data, Experiment Line [] to structure the derivations on the experiment line definitions, and DCMI[] to aggregate the metadata.
